# Json Resume -> Rirekisho

This is a just a small pet project to render a Json Resume into a Japanese style CV,

### Custom Json Resume
For the moment I had to modify a bit of a JSON resume to add some missing parts into what I call JsonRirekisho which is basically a variant of a Json resume that has the missing parts to comply with a Japanese Resume.

## Note
This is a pet project, it should not be used in any way to apply to japanese companies, most of the code was generated by ChatGPT with some modifications on my part for errors and other stuff.
